question hould ask
1. dose the array contains duplicate element?
2, will array come in like null or empty
3. does the retuen order matter? [1,3] <==> [3,1]

logic 1 double loop loop 
Time: O(n^2)
space: O(1)

logic 2 - two pointer methods
not apply in this question since it require sort array, but nice idea
1. sort array
2. left and right pointer
3 basic on value of sum of left and right value shift left or right pointer
time: basic on sorting array + O(n)
space: basic on sorting array + O(1)


logic 3 - hash map
1. loop array(nums) wiht index
    1.1 push element into hashmap if hashmap[num] is null
    1.2 complement = target - num
    1.3 if hashmap has complement item and the index does not same as current element
        return complement's index and current index
Time: O(n)
space: O(n)
